          <h2>Correlations Between Behavioral Risk Factors and Demographics</h2>
          <p>Obesity prevalence increases with decrease of household income, 
            as we see the states with higher household median income and lower poverty percentage have 
            significantly lower obesity prevalence. Obesity is higher in adults between the ages of 35 and 40 years old.</p>
          
          <p>A correlation between low income and smoking can also be seen in the graph. The 
            states with lower household median income have significantly higher smoking prevalence. 
            Also the graph shows that smoking rate is higher among adults between the ages of
            35 and 41 years old.</p>

          <p>The graph also shows that access to healthcare improves with increase in household median income, 
            in general the states with household median income above $65,000 have a smaller percentage of people without healthcare. Lack of healthcare
            is higher among adults between the ages of 36 and 40 years old.</p>
